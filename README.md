# DistributedActorsTest

Learning and testing of distributed actors.

## "NonDistributed"

The "NonDistributed" part is the implementation of a simple framework that allows the (parallel) execution of workers for the same type of work items, together with a sample application of processing documents (the processing of the documents will only be simulated).

This part does not use distributed actors yet.
